* MP3
    smpeg.dll (used for mp3 playback) tends to crash unexpectedly. It's
    encouraged to use OGG, instead. Use MP3 at your own risk.
* Debug mode
    When running in language debug mode and the debug thread is waiting for
    input, the program will not end until *any* input (including an empty
    string) is given. The interpreter and the image loader will be destroyed
    cleanly (thereby commiting "global.sav" and "nonsflog.dat"), so it's
    otherwise completely safe.
    The thread can be killed early with "exit" or "quit".
* Linux
    ???
* Miscellanea
    Vertical centering produces incorrect results when the size of a page of
    text is greater than the size of the screen. This will probably be fixed in
    future releases.
