    * Implemented: split, isdown, isfull, getcursorpos, textgosub, ispage,
        puttext, labellog, underline.
    * Unimplemented: kidokumode, kidokuskip, skipoff, isskip.
    * Implemented mouse wheel.
    * Variable indices can now be negative.
    * Added automatic encoding detection.
    * Added "auto" to the possible encodings list. This is now the default.
    * doc/Changes.txt reformatted.
    * Save file version upgraded.
    * Added INSTALL.txt with installation instructions.
    * Changed implementation of expression evaluator to a Bison-generated
      parser-evaluator. Because of MinGW's poor implementation, the code can no
      longer be compiled with it.
    * Discontinued support for O/NScripter savegames (save*.dat).
    * The array identification method has changed from C-style identifiers to
      integers. As a result, all savegames for scripts that use arrays will be
      incorrectly loaded.
    * Labels are now C-style identifiers.
    * Added string concatenation support in expressions.
    * Added asynchronous animation support for all layers.
    * Added full sprite string support (see doc/NScrAPI/NScrAPI.xml#lsp) for the
        syntax "[:(trans-mode)[/(animation)];](filename)".
    * Removed -transparency-method-layer and -transparency-method-anim as
        command line arguments.
    * Fixed serious bug in the string reduction mechanism.
    * Fixed bug related to text speed.
    * Fixed bug in the bilinear interpolation function.
    * Fixed bug related to !sd and !s# escape sequences.
    * Fixed a bug that caused loading a sound on channel X to crash if a
      wavestop had been issued on channel X while no sound was loaded at that
      channel.

        savefileexist, savescreenshot, savescreenshot2, savetime.
    * New commands: savetime2.
    * New command line arguments: -!reset-out-files -!redirect
    * Improved redirection files behavior.
    * Unimplemented commands: killmenu
    * global.sav and nonsflog.dat moved to the save directory.

        both Windows and Linux.
    * New commands: centerh, centerv
    * New convenience command line argument: -save-directory
