--help
-?
-h
Shows a message with all options.


--version
Display version number.


-save-directory <directory name>
Override the default save game subdirectory with a custom name.
By default, the engine performs a partial SHA1 on the loaded script (not on the
actual script file) and uses the first 64 bits to create a directory.
For example, calling ONSlaught without this option might cause the save games to
go in
"C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\.ONSlaught\e38ba7ef 3bd29d16\" in
Windows XP, and in "~/.ONSlaught/e38ba7ef 3bd29d16/" in Linux, which is very
cumbersome.
Using the following command line:
ONSlaught -save-directory "Parrot Sketch"
would cause save games to go in
"C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\.ONSlaught\Parrot Sketch\" in
Windows XP, and in "~/.ONSlaught/Parrot Sketch" in Linux.

At the time of this writing (2009-01-24), this option only has effect on Linux
and Windows. Any other platform the engine is compiled for will put its save
game files in the working directory.

Directory name suggestion: In order to avoid conflicts for systems with multiple
games installed, the best naming scheme would probably be
<Game name>-<ISO 639-1 Code>[-<version>]. The version is optional (note that
it's not always possible or reliable to load save games for one
script version into a different script version).
For example, for an English version of Tsukihime, version 1.5: Tsukihime-en-1.5
For the Czech version: Tsukihime-cs-1.5

-verbosity <number>
Sets the level of verbosity. Defaults to 0.
Levels:
Level 0: No logging.
Level 1: Log line numbers being interpreted.
Level 2: Log results and details for expressions.
Level 255: Reserved for engine debugging.


-f
Start in fullscreen.


-r <number> <number> <number> <number>
Sets the screen resolution. The first two numbers are width and height of the
virtual screen (script coordinates shound be given based on this resolution).
The second two numbers are width and height of the physical screen or window
graphical output will go to. Linear interpolation is used to resize the picture,
so the rescale ratio (realResolution/virtualResolution) should never be above 2
(for example, if the virtual resolution is 640x480, the real resolution should
not be greater than 1280x960). Interpolation artifacts are obvious after scales
of 2. If the ratios don't match, the difference will be compensated with
vertical black bars at the sides or horizontal bars at the top and bottom,
depending on the case. The picture is never cropped. Wasted screen space is
better than lost picture. Specially for resizes such as 16:9->4:3.


-script {auto|<path> <encryption method>}
Selects a script file and encryption method or enables auto-selection.
Files are sought in this order (in auto):

 1. "0.txt", mode 0
 2. "00.txt", mode 0
 3. "nscr_sec.dat", mode 2
 4. "nscript.___", mode 3
 5. "nscript.dat", mode 1

Encryption mode (technical) details:
Mode 0, or no encryption.
Mode 1, or xor84: unencrypted_byte[i]=encrypted_byte[i]^0x84;
Mode 2, or rotating xor: Given an array ring[]={0x79,0x57,0x0D,0x80,0x04},
    unencrypted_byte[i]=encrypted_byte[i]^ring[i%5].
Mode 3, or transform and xor: Not supported.


-encoding {sjis|iso-8859-1|utf8|ucs2}
Selects the encoding to be used on the script file. Default is sjis.


-dump-text <file name>
Enables text dump mode. All script text is outputted to the file given. The
contents of the file are kept between executions.


-s
Disables sound.
This doesn't just zeroes the volume, it avoids sound initialization. With this
flag, sound can't be turned back on without restarting the engine.


-music-format {auto|ogg|mp3|it|xm|s3m|mod}
Selects the music format to be used. 'auto's priority is as follows: ogg, mp3,
it, xm, s3m, and then mod.


-music-directory <directory>
Selects where to look for the music. Defaults to "./CD"


-transparency-method-anim {chroma|alpha}
Selects the trasparency method for cursors.


-transparency-method-layer {old|alpha}
Selects the trasparency method for layer images.



-image-cache-size <size>
Sets the size for the image cache. -1 is infinite, 0 disables the cache
(default).


-redirect
Redirects stdout to "stdout.txt", stderr to "stderr.txt", and stdlog to
"stdlog.txt".
Error messages are sent to stderr. Debug messages (both internal and external)
are sent to stdlog. Any other information that doesn't fit in these two
categories is sent to stdout.
This option also unconditionally disables debug.


-!reset-out-files
Only used with "-redirect".
Keeps the contents of stdout.txt, stderr.txt, and stdlog.txt when it opens them
and puts the date and time as identification.


-debug
Enables debug mode. In debug mode, it is possible to view and change the value
of variables.
At the time of writing, some commands cause the engine to crash. A queueing
system is being worked out.


-no-console
Hides the console (only for Windows).
Since the console can't be used, it also disables -debug.
