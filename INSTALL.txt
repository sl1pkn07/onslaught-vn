This document describes the compilation and/or installation for the various
platforms.

Unices:
Compilation:
cmake .
make
In order for the compilation process to succeed, the following files/links
should be in the system's libraries directory:
libSDL.so
libSDL_image.so
libSDL_mixer.so
libbz2.so
libfreetype.so
After a successful build, the binary will be put in bin-*-*/ONSlaught.
E.g. bin-Linux-i686/ONSlaught. The actual name will depend on the system and
architecture.

Installation:
The best way to install is to move this file to /usr/bin/ (most likely will
require root priviledges). Failing that, ~/bin/ should also work.
