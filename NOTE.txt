static/ contains the files that remain the same between releases. In order to
    correctly compile for source, it's necessary to merge the files and
    subdirectories here, with the ones in the desired version. Graphical desktop
    environments makes this very easy, thankfully.
trunk/ contains the current development version.
tags/ contains or will contain releases from 20090127 onwards (20090126 is
    therefore not feature here).
branches/ contains or will contain development branches that might generate at
    some point. These are normally experimental versions of branch/, created to
    test some new feature.
