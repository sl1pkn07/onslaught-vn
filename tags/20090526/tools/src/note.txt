include.7z contains only the Boost include files for Visual C++.

Compiling nsaio on Linux is as straightforward as riding a unicycle. I've
noticed that some versions of Boost require boost_system to link
boost_filesystem, while others don't. There doesn't appear to be any concensus
on the names the libraries should have. OpenSuse, for instance, installs by
default only part of Boost with the pattern libboost_*.*, but Boost uses the
pattern libboost_*-<compiler>-mt-<version>.*
