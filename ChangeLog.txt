        both Windows and Linux.

      * Added distro-independent Linux binaries for x86 and x86-64. The x86-64
        binary is HUGE, but I'm sure in this day and age that's not a problem,
        and the current compression algorithms do wonders.
      * The tools are now in archives of their own.

      * Updated Arguments.txt.
